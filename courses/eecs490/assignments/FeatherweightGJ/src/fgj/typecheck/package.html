FeatherweightGJ typechecking.  The typechecker maps
{@link fgj.ast.Term terms} to types, which in FeatherweightGJ are
the {@link java.lang.String} names of classes, together with a list of
{@link fgj.ast.Type} arguments.  A well-typed
program does not get the evaluator stuck unless a bad cast is executed.
