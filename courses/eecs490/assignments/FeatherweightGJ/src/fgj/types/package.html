Support classes used to build the class table and extract
class information from it.  The class table (<i>CT</i> in the
FeatherweightGJ paper) must be built before typechecking and
evaluation since the judgments describing them in the paper rely
on its existence.  Some errors are discovered during class table
construction, most notably cyclic subtyping errors.  These errors
are thrown as ClassTableExceptions.
