Abstract syntax structures for the FeatherweightGJ language.  The
parser, if successful, creates a syntax tree with a Program as the root.
All objects of these classes are immutable--after the parser creates
abstract syntax, it cannot be modified in place.  The typechecker and
evaluator do not require syntax tree rewriting and thus it is not
supported.
