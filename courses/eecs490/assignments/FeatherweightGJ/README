BUILDING

The build system for FeatherweightGJ uses a tool called Ant, from the
Apache project.  Ant is similar to make, but it uses an XML-based file
format (the build.xml file in this directory).  You should not have to
edit this file for your project.

If you don't have ant on your computer, you can download it from
http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~pdarga/pub/ant.zip.  This archive will unzip
into a folder called ant; add this folder to your path.

To get a list of the build targets for FeatherweightGJ, type "ant -p"
at the command prompt.  The most important of these is fgj-jar; by typing
"ant fgj-jar", or simply "ant", the Java source files are rebuilt and a
Java archive (Jar) file called fgj.jar is created in this directory.

RUNNING

After fgj.jar has been built, the typechecker and evaluator can be run by
typing "java -jar fgj.jar tests/empty.fgj"; replace tests/empty.fgj with any
test case you wish to run.

SUBMITTING

Typing "ant submit" creates a file named submit.zip in this directory.
This archive contains your modifications to fgj.typecheck.TypeChecker
and fgj.typecheck.TypeEnvironment, and your test suite in the tests/
subdirectory.  No other files are submitted, so make sure you limit your
editing to those files.
